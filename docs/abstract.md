This project focuses on the design and deployment of an interactive data visualization system using cloud computing and virtualization technologies. The system enables users to access dashboards remotely through cloud platforms while being hosted inside a virtual machine environment. By integrating data visualization tools with cloud infrastructure, the project ensures scalability, accessibility, and platform independence. This approach demonstrates how modern visualization systems can be efficiently deployed using virtualization and cloud computing for real-world analytical applications.
