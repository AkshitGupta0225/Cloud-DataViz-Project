## Abstract

In the modern digital era, organizations generate massive volumes of data that require effective analysis and interpretation. Raw data in tabular form is often difficult to understand and does not support quick decision-making. Data visualization plays a critical role in converting complex datasets into meaningful graphical representations such as charts, dashboards, and reports.

This project focuses on the design and deployment of an interactive data visualization system using cloud computing and virtualization technologies. The system enables users to access dashboards remotely through cloud platforms while being hosted inside a virtual machine environment. Virtualization ensures isolation, portability, and efficient utilization of computing resources, while cloud computing enables scalability and remote accessibility.

The proposed system integrates data visualization tools with cloud infrastructure to provide platform independence and centralized deployment. Users can interact with visual dashboards, apply filters, and analyze trends without being restricted to a local system. This approach demonstrates how modern visualization systems can be efficiently deployed using virtualization and cloud computing technologies.

The project highlights the practical application of cloud computing concepts, virtual machine deployment, and interactive visualization techniques. It serves as a real-world example of how emerging tools and technologies can be combined to build scalable and accessible analytical solutions.
