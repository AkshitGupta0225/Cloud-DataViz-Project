Traditional data visualization systems are often restricted to local machines, limiting accessibility and scalability. Organizations require visualization platforms that can be accessed remotely while maintaining system isolation and reliability. This project aims to design a cloud-based interactive data visualization system using virtualization to provide a scalable, accessible, and efficient analytics solution.
