## Problem Statement

Traditional data visualization systems are commonly deployed on local machines, which limits accessibility, scalability, and collaboration. Such systems require manual installation and configuration on individual devices, making maintenance and updates difficult. Additionally, local deployment restricts users from accessing dashboards remotely, reducing flexibility and real-time data access.

With the increasing reliance on data-driven decision-making, organizations require visualization platforms that can be accessed from anywhere while ensuring system isolation and reliability. There is a need for a solution that integrates data visualization with cloud computing and virtualization to overcome the limitations of traditional systems.

The problem addressed in this project is the lack of a centralized, scalable, and remotely accessible data visualization platform. This project aims to design and implement a cloud-based interactive data visualization system hosted within a virtual machine environment. The system will allow users to analyze data efficiently while ensuring portability, scalability, and platform independence.
