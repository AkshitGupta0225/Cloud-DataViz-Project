## Data Preprocessing Steps

The raw dataset was preprocessed to make it suitable for analysis
and visualization.

1. Duplicate records were identified and removed from the dataset.
2. Missing values in sales and profit columns were handled to avoid
   incorrect calculations.
3. Inconsistent or empty region values were standardized.
4. Column names were reviewed to ensure consistency and clarity.
5. Date values were verified to follow a uniform format.

After preprocessing, a clean and structured dataset was generated
for reliable data visualization.
