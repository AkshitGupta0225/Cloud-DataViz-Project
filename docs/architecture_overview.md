## System Architecture Overview

The proposed system follows a layered architecture to ensure modularity, scalability, and ease of deployment. The architecture consists of the following layers:

### Data Layer
The data layer contains datasets stored in CSV format. These datasets act as the input for the visualization system and can be updated as required.

### Visualization Layer
The visualization layer uses data visualization tools to generate charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards. This layer allows users to explore data, apply filters, and analyze trends.

### Virtualization Layer
The visualization system is hosted within a virtual machine. Virtualization ensures isolation from the host system, platform independence, and portability across different environments.

### Cloud Access Layer
The cloud layer enables remote access to the dashboards through internet connectivity. Users can access the system from different devices without installing local software.

This layered architecture supports centralized deployment, efficient resource utilization, and scalability while maintaining system reliability.
